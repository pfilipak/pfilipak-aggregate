# javarosa-libraries:

This is a special build of javarosa using the tree at https://bitbucket.org/m.sundt/javarosa

exposes bind and prompt attributes, and numerous contributed fixes from SurveyCTO and others.

# odk-httpclient-gae:

and compiling the OpenId4Java project.

You need to install both the parent and jar projects.

# spring-security-openid-3.2.4.odk-SNAPSHOT:

This is a merge of deltas that can be built by pulling the Aggregate (Components) sources
and applying the spring-security-patch to the corresponding 3.2.4 SpringSecurity sources.

# odk-tomcatutil:

This can be installed by pulling the Aggregate (Components) sources
and running 'mvn install' in the TomcatUtils project.  Or,

# gwt-google-maps-v3-snapshot:

This can be installed by pulling the Aggregate (Components) sources
and building the gwt-google-maps-v3 project. 
See the Aggregate (Components) README.txt file for how this was built. It
uses the sources that were originally located here (but have since been removed):
http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-maps-v3/

# jai-imageio-core-standalone-1.2-pre-dr-b04-2010-04-30.jar

(this is NOT registered with maven).

This file: jai-imageio-core-standalone-1.2-pre-dr-b04-2010-04-30.jar 
is built from the sources here: git://github.com/stain/jai-imageio-core.git
It is copied into the war at the time the installer is created.  This file 
is only used on Tomcat deployments by the odk-tomcat-util.jar.

# gdata-src.java-1.47.1 -- various jars:

maven_gdata_installs -- a list of the jars used and the maven commands to install them.

The gdata libraries need to be locally installed into Maven.  
Download the 1.47.1 gdata libraries from http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/downloads/list

The ANT build script automatically handles this.
